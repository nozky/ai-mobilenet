# Machine Learning
***Is a Subset of AI(Artificial Intelligence).***

**Artificial intelligence (AI)** refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. 

**Machine learning** is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

***Neurons***

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are composed of artificial neurons which are conceptually derived from biological neurons. Each artificial neuron has inputs and produces a single output which can be sent to multiple other neurons. The inputs can be the feature values of a sample of external data, such as images or documents, or they can be the outputs of other neurons. The outputs of the final output neurons of the neural net accomplish the task, such as recognizing an object in an image.

A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons, or in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes
